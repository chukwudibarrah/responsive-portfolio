# Module 2 Challenge: Portfolio

## Description

The goal is to build a portfolio page that I can add to as the course progresses. 

A portfolio of work can showcase my skills and talents. An effective portfolio highlights my strongest work as well as the thought processes behind it. 

This challenge helps me apply some of the core skills I've recently learned: flexbox, media queries, and CSS variables.


## Goals

* The landing page should present my name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about me, my work and contact details.
* When one of the links in the navigation is clicked then the UI scrolls to the corresponding section.
* The section about my work should contain work titled images of my applications.
* The image for my first application should be larger in size than the others.
* The images should include links to direct users to the deployed application.
* The page can be resized or viewed on various screens and devices.
